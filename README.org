#+TOC: headlines 2

* Description

Simple single-source simulation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant][langton's ant]], made in under 500 lines of
C.

Some of the main features:
- Custom grid size and delay at runtime.
- Very easy to modify color palette with no size limit. Supports 4 possible
  rotations when stepping on each color. Modified at compile-time.
- Unlimited number of ants at runtime, spawned by clicking on the grid.
- Grid overlay with =g=.
- Single stepping with =Left arrow= or automatic stepping with =Space=.
- Easily customizable by changing macros inside the source.

* Building

Clone the repository and run =make=. Make sure you have [[https://www.libsdl.org/][SDL2]] installed.

#+begin_src console
$ git clone https://github.com/8dcc/langtons-ant
$ cd langtons-ant
$ make
...
#+end_src

* Usage

You can specify the width, height and delay at runtime.

#+begin_src console
$ ./langtons-ant
Grid size: 100x100
Cell size: 5 px
Delay: 10 ms

Step: 536

$ ./langtons-ant 50 20 200
Grid size: 50x20
Cell size: 5 px
Delay: 200 ms

Step: 231
#+end_src

| =q=           | Quit the program.                                      |
| =ESC=         | Same as =q=.                                             |
| =g=           | Toggle grid overlay.                                   |
| =Left Arrow=  | Single step.                                           |
| =Space=       | Toggle auto-stepping.                                  |
| =Up Arrow=    | Increase number of steps per frame when auto-stepping. |
| =Down Arrow=  | Decrease number of steps per frame when auto-stepping. |
| =Left Click=  | Add ant at the specified position.                     |
| =Right Click= | Remove ant at the specified position.                  |
